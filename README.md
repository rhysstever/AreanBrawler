# ArenaBrawler

## About
Arena Brawler is a 2D-top down RPG brawler where the player must take down waves of enemies to level up and acquire gold

## Organization
We have a Trello! Check it out [here](https://trello.com/b/OZ2GQj81).

This is where we create and outline different tasks and one of us will pick it up to complete it. We also have a discussion list. Each card in the list is a topic that requires some form of discussion, whether its a complex process that needs to be explained, a mechanic that needs to be ironed out, or a design that needs to be agreed upon.
